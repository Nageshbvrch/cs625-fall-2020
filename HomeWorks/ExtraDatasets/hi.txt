**Advantages:**




**Disadvantages:**


Handles Large Data Easily
A box plot is a highly visually effective way of viewing a clear summary of one or more sets of data.
A box plot is one of very few statistical graph methods that show outliers.

Box plot

**Advantages:**

* In the output five **glyphs** are easily visible. 

* Median values can be identified and compared.

* Outliers can be clearly identified


**Disadvantages:**

* I could not identify all the statistical values using the boxplot.

* The range and IQR could not be distinguished.


Exact Values Not Retained
Hides the multimodality and other features of distributions.
Confusing for some audiences.
Mean often difficult to locate.
Outlier calculation too rigid – “outliers” may be industry-based or case-by-case.


Histogram

**Advantages:**

* Can easily compare data.

* Can differentiate range of data in each bin.

* Can easily find the approximate number of people with corresponding response.

* Can easily identify the highest and lowest values.



**Disadvantages:**

* It is hard to tell the exact value corresponding to each bin.

* Too few bins can leave out important information.

ECDF

**Advantages:**

* Was able to fit entire data in the definite axis


**Disadvantages:**

* Could not find out the outliers

* Corresponding value of each distribution cannot be identified.

* The continuity between the range of each interval could not be identified.

The histogram with smaller binsize give better visibility of the data distribution.
